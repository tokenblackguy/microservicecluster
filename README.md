# microservicecluster

Can be used to test in a minikube single node cluster. Just clone the files and then run the deployment and service files.

Same cluster will also be done using kubeadm on a multinode cluster in the future.

This is for testing purposes, you can play with it and learn kubectl commands as well as how pods communicate with each other.
